# Project Files Location: #

The project files are conveniently organized within the repository. Below are the locations of each file:

1. DDL and DML Files:

These essential files for database creation and sample data manipulation are located in the SQL_Files folder of the repository.

DDL (Data Definition Language) statements can be found in the DDL.sql file.
DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements containing sample data are stored in the DML.sql file.

2. ER Diagram and Relational Schema:

Visual representations of the database design can be accessed in the Database_Design folder.

The ER diagram, illustrating entity relationships and cardinalities, is available in the ER_Diagram_Project.png file.
For a simplified view of the database structure, refer to the Relational_Schema_Project.png file, showcasing the reduction of the ER diagram into relational schemas.

# Conceptual Design: #

- Members Table: This table stores information about the members of the health and fitness club. It includes details such as their names, email addresses, membership types, and physical metrics like weight, height, body fat percentage, and cardio fitness level. Each member is uniquely identified by a member_id.

- Trainers Table: This table holds data about the trainers employed by the club. It includes their names, email addresses, specialization areas, and availability timings. Similar to the members table, each trainer is assigned a unique trainer_id.

- Administrative Staff Table: This table contains details of the administrative staff working in different departments of the club, such as facilities, finance, member services, etc. It includes their names, email addresses, departments, and roles within the organization. Each staff member is identified by an admin_id.

- Fitness Goals Table: Here, the fitness goals set by members are recorded. Each goal is associated with a specific member (member_id), and it includes details like the type of goal (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain), the target value to achieve, and the target date for achieving the goal. Each goal is uniquely identified by a goal_id.

- Exercise Routines Table: This table tracks the exercise routines followed by club members. It records details such as the member performing the routine (member_id), the description of the routine, and the date when it was performed. Each routine is identified by a unique routine_id.

- Fitness Achievements Table: This table stores information about the fitness achievements attained by members. It includes details such as the member achieving the milestone (member_id), the description of the achievement, and the date when it was accomplished. Each achievement is uniquely identified by an achievement_id.

- Rooms Table: This table maintains data about the rooms available in the club premises. It includes information like the room name and its capacity. Each room is assigned a unique identifier (room_id).

- Classes Table: This table represents the fitness classes offered by the club. It includes details such as the class name, required equipment, availability timings, and the room where the class takes place (room_id). Each class is uniquely identified by a class_id.

- Bookings Table: This table tracks the bookings made by members for personal training sessions or classes. It records details such as the member making the booking (member_id), the trainer assigned (if applicable), the class booked (if applicable), the type of booking (personal training or class), the start and end times of the booking, and the room where the booking takes place (room_id). Each booking is identified by a unique booking_id.

- Equipment Table: This table stores information about the equipment available in the club. It includes details such as the equipment name and the date of its last maintenance. Each piece of equipment is uniquely identified by an equipment_id.

- Notifications Table: This table manages notifications sent to club members. It includes details such as the member receiving the notification (member_id), the message content, whether the notification has been read, and the timestamp of when it was created. Each notification is identified by a unique notification_id.

- Bills Table: Finally, the bills table tracks the financial transactions related to club bookings. It includes details such as the member responsible for the bill (member_id), a description of the bill, the amount due, the billing date, the due date, and the status of the bill. Each bill is uniquely identified by a bill_id.

# Assumptions: #

1. User Registration and Authentication:

- A simple login experience is implemented where users, including members, trainers, and administrative staff, can register accounts.
- Trainers and administrative staff require a special general password during registration for enhanced authentication. This password is known only to authorized personnel.
- Login functionality is simplified to email-based login without passwords for ease of use.

2. Trainer Availability and Scheduling:

- Each trainer has their own fixed hourly schedule each day, implying their availability for personal training sessions during those hours.
- Trainers are responsible for managing their schedules and setting the time slots for which they are available.

3. Billing and Payment Handling:

- For simplicity, personal training sessions incur a fixed fee of $100, while group classes have a fixed fee of $65.
- Billing is automatically handled by the system, with members able to view pending bills and make payments.
- Administrative staff have oversight of all bills, including pending and paid bills, ensuring effective management.

4. Booking Management and Notifications:

- Personal training sessions can either be conducted in a room or elsewhere, while group classes must be conducted in designated rooms with assigned room IDs.
- When trainers reschedule their availability, affected bookings are flagged for cancellation. Trainers are prompted to confirm the rescheduling, and affected members are notified accordingly.
- In the event of administrative actions such as room removal, affected bookings are automatically reassigned to available rooms. If no available rooms remain, the bookings are canceled. For class removals, bookings are always canceled. Members are promptly notified of any changes.

5. Initial Values in Tables:

- All tables, except for notifications, have initial values populated within them. Notifications are generated dynamically as bookings are canceled or rooms are reassigned.

These assumptions aim to streamline user interactions, simplify system operations, and ensure efficient management of bookings, scheduling, and billing processes.

# Bonus Feature: #

For additional functionality, the system has been enriched with two bonus features:

1. Trainer and Admin Registration with Enhanced Authentication:

Trainers and administrative staff members are now able to register accounts within the system. However, to ensure higher authentication standards, a special general password is required during the registration process. This password is known only to authorized personnel and serves as an added layer of security for trainer and admin accounts.

2. Notification System for Member Bookings:

A notification system has been implemented to enhance member experience. Members will now receive notifications when their bookings are canceled due to various reasons such as rescheduled trainer availabilities or class cancellations initiated by the administrative staff. These notifications aim to keep members informed and minimize inconvenience.

These bonus features aim to elevate user experience, improve system security, and streamline communication between members, trainers, and administrative staff.
